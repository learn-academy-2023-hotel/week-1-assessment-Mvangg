# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is an electronic tool that keeps code under control. Github is similar to a storage drive that is utilized to communicate our git to others and vice versa, as well as store it like a google drive. 

Researched answer: Git is a strong tool that is utlized to store code systematically while GitHub is utilized to store git which allows users to work on projects together.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index is the placement. For example: who is patient zero, patient one, patient two, etc. Value is what is in the placement. For example: patient zero is Sick John, patient one is Starving Marvin, patient two is Zombie Romeo, etc. 

Researched answer: An array's value is an element that is a javascript data type whereas an array's index is a location for each element in said array. The zero index applies to arrays such as my previous example: patient zero, patient one, patient two, etc. 

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are bracket users, Strings are quotation users. You may put strings into an array but it can not be the other way, where an array can be in a string. When using a string variable, there can only be one string per string variable for example: var firstOne = "Hello!". In an array, there can be multiple elements/items for example: var secondOne = [1, 2, 3, "four", "five", [6, 7, 8]]. With an array, each index is the element between the seperated (,) for example: index[3] = "four", index[5] = [6, 7, 8], whereas index[3] in myString = l. Both strings and arrays are similar as they are both variables that can be utilized in a statement. They both contain element(s)/item(s) such as the previous examples. Both can be utilized to find indexes within itself as well such as the previous examples. 

Researched answer: An array is a variable that can store multiple data in a group. It allows users to be able to be able to pull each data individually and "play" with it; example: [1, 2, 3, "four", "five", [6, 7, 8]] String is a group of characters that's between quotation marks; example: "Hello!" Both array's data and string's characters can be pulled through index, both have a length property which can be called using .length, and both can be utilized in for loops. A huge difference between array and strings is that arrays may be modified but strings may not. To see a modified data of the string, a new variable must be created. Arrays may also hold many different data types and strings can not/ only characters. 

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

Encapsulation: Compiling data (example - food: banana) and functions (example - increment: i++) to keep data with each other and not involved with outside data.

Inheritance: Allows objects to retrieve codes that were used to define another object. (Example - object1: food - code defined to be eaten. object2: apple - code they are defined to be red but pulling the code to define food, apple is defined to be red and defined to be eaten.)

Polymorphism: Allows objects to have multiple definitions. (Example = object: food, object: apple; object: food - has a taste, object: apple - has a taste of sweetness; each object utilized the base of object: food and defined itself.)

Abstraction: Dumbing things down to only what is needed. Sets as an object obtaining basic information and sub-objects retrieve the basic information and add it's own definition. (Example - object: Food - has color(not defined); object: apple - is red(defined); object: orange - is orange(defined))

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: A built-in method that takes a set of code/function as data, usually in an array. Easier said: function = value. The three parameters in Higher Order Functions are value, index, and array. However, only value is a requirement in higher order functions. 

2. Jest: A testing framework in javascript that enables us to verify our written codes are functioning as expected.

3. Objects: A collection of data that comes as a pair; key:value. Example: { car: "Mercedes" } car is the key/category, Mercedes is the value/definition.
